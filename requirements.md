# Smart Parking & Mobility Management System with EV Charging

## 1. Problem Overview
Urban public and commercial spaces face severe parking congestion and limited access to EV charging infrastructure. Drivers waste time searching for parking slots and available chargers, leading to traffic congestion, fuel wastage, and poor user experience. Existing systems lack real-time intelligence and predictive decision-making.

## 2. Objective
To build an AI-powered smart parking system that provides real-time parking and EV charging availability, predictive insights, and seamless booking to improve access, efficiency, and utilization of public infrastructure.

## 3. User Roles
- End User (Driver)
- Parking Administrator
- System Administrator

## 4. Functional Requirements
- Real-time parking slot detection using IoT sensors
- EV charging slot availability monitoring
- AI-based demand and availability prediction
- Slot booking and reservation
- Navigation to available parking/charging slots
- Digital payment integration
- Admin dashboard for monitoring and analytics

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability to support city-level deployment
- High availability and real-time responsiveness
- Secure data handling and encrypted communication
- Cloud-based deployment for reliability
- Cost-effective and modular design

## 6. Assumptions
- IoT sensors are deployed at parking and charging locations
- Users have access to smartphones and internet connectivity

## 7. Constraints
- Initial setup cost for IoT sensors
- Network dependency for real-time updates

## 8. Expected Outcome
The system will reduce parking search time, decrease congestion, improve EV adoption, and enhance the efficiency of public and commercial parking infrastructure.
